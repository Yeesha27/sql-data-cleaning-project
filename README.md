Welcome to the **Data cleaning with MYsql project** repository!
This project demonstrates now I transformed a messy HR dataset into a clean and well-structured one using MYSQL. Through series of data cleaning tasks, I turned raw, inconsistent data into a reliable dataset that supports accurate and efficient decision making.

## Project Requirements

### Cleaning a messy HR dataset

#### Objective
To transform a messy dataset into a clean and  reliable dataset that supports accuracy and informed decision making.

##### Specifications
- **Data Quality Check**: This involves verifying the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the dataset. I checked for missing values, duplicate records, incorrect data types, and invalid entries to ensure the dataset was clean and reliable before further processing
- **Data Standardization** : This step focuses on bringing the data into a uniform format and structure. I standardized text values (performance_score) to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity
- **Invalid Date**: Here, I identified and corrected dates that were in the wrong format or outside a valid range to maintain accuracy in time-based analysis.
- **Removal of Unwanted Space** : I removed extra spaces (leading and trailing spaces) from the dataset to make sure all fields were clean and properly formatted for analysis.
- **Handling Missing Data**: This step involved identifying and fixing blank or missing values in the dataset. I replaced empty spaces in the Age column with NULL, and filled blank fields in the Email and Phone Number columns with 'N/A' to maintain data completeness and clarity.
